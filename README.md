# California-Housing
I've read this project earlier but tried recreating it with some modifications, The main objective was to write more organised code and make a workflow. Although I thought of including pipelines too but then I didnt. Pipelines some other day. This was just cleaning and feature eng. along with comparing the performance of Linear and Ensemble models.
